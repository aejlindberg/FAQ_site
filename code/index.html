        Where is space?
      </div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>Outer space, or just space, is the expanse that exists beyond the Earth and between celestial bodies. Outer space is not completely emptyâ€”it is a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays.

        Can I visit space?
      </div>
      <div class="description">
        <p>Yes. Space tourism is space travel for recreational, leisure or business purposes. There are several different types of space tourism, including orbital, suborbital and lunar space tourism. To date, orbital space tourism has been performed only by the Russian Space Agency. Work also continues towards developing suborbital space tourism vehicles. This is being done by aerospace companies like Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic.
